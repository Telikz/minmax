                                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6">How to Practice Yoga</h1>
                                <ol class="list-none list-outside mb-6">
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Create a comfortable space:</strong> Find a quiet, comfortable area in your home or outdoors where you can practice yoga without distractions. Make sure the space is free from noise and interruptions.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Choose your yoga gear:</strong> Use a yoga mat for cushioning and support. Comfortable clothes that allow free movement are also important.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Start with basic poses:</strong> Begin with simple poses such as the Mountain Pose, Child's Pose, or Downward Dog. Gradually introduce more complex asanas as your flexibility and strength improve.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Focus on your breath:</strong> Breathing is central to yoga. Practice synchronizing your movements with your breath.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Include relaxation and meditation:</strong> Finish your practice with a relaxation pose like Corpse Pose (Savasana) and a few minutes of meditation to integrate the benefits of your practice.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Establish a routine:</strong> Consistency is key for reaping the benefits of yoga. Try to practice at the same time every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. </li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Join a class or use online resources:</strong> To get started, you may want to join a class or use online resources. This will ensure you're practicing the postures correctly and safely.</li>
                                </ol>
