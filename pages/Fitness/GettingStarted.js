                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Improve Mobility and Flexibility:</strong> A well-rounded fitness regimen includes flexibility and mobility work, which can improve your range of motion, decrease injury risk, and enhance performance in other physical activities.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Promote Better Sleep:</strong> Regular exercise can help regulate your sleep patterns, leading to more restful and restorative sleep.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Whether you're aiming to improve your health, enhance your physical appearance, boost your mood, or increase your strength and endurance, a regular fitness regimen can be a powerful tool to help you achieve your goals.

                                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-6">How to Start a Fitness Routine</h1>
                                <ol class="list-none list-outside mb-6">
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Set Clear Goals:</strong> Define what you want to achieve with your fitness regimen. This could be losing weight, building muscle, improving your running time, or simply boosting your overall health. Your goals will guide your workout plan.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Create a Balanced Routine:</strong> An effective fitness routine includes cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and flexibility work. Be sure to include all three in your plan.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Start Slow and Gradually Increase:</strong> If you're new to regular exercise, start with light to moderate workouts and gradually increase the intensity as your fitness improves.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Make It a Habit:</strong> Consistency is key in fitness. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, according to health guidelines.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Recovery Is Important:</strong> Ensure you're giving your body enough time to rest and recover between workouts. This includes getting enough sleep and eating a balanced, nutritious diet.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Stay Motivated:</strong> Find ways to keep your workouts interesting. This could be trying new activities, working out with a friend, or setting new fitness goals.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Seek Professional Guidance:</strong> If you're unsure where to start, consider hiring a personal trainer or joining a fitness class. They can provide you with a structured workout plan and ensure you're performing exercises correctly and safely.</li>
